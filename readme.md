Some of my Magento 2 sample code.

#### There are 4 Magento directories of extensions and themes
1. Only Cufflinks, developed during my employment with Lindy Bop in Manchester.
1. Asian Fashion, a project I've developed in my spare time, not complete yet.
1. UK POS, whilst I worked at UK Point Of Sale in Stockport.
1. Goldenbag, an affiliate shopping site which is a personal project.

## Only Cufflinks
- Just an image uploader to upload multiple custom images to appear in blocks on the homepage. This allows staff to upload images whenever they need to and don't need a programer to intervene.
- The front end uses Slick Carousel slider to loop through the large image carousel.

## Asian Fashion
- A "Refer a Friend" module to introduce a friend and they both receive generated coupon codes for discounts.

## UK POS
- A "Knowledge Hub" which is a collection of articles, a bit of WordPress functionality but in M2.

## Goldenbag
- A module to scrape an Ali Express to pull down a product's images and save them in the Magento product's image gallery.
